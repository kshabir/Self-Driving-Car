Project Summary:
In this project, I developed an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm using the CARLA simulator to estimate a vehicle's state (position, velocity, and orientation) based on IMU, GNSS, and LIDAR data. The prediction step relies on IMU data, integrating accelerometer and gyroscope readings to estimate the state, while the measurement step incorporates GNSS and LIDAR to correct the predictions using a Kalman gain. Part 1 focused on implementing basic EKF motion and measurement updates using these sensors. Part 2 introduced calibration errors to test the algorithm's robustness, adjusting noise parameters for optimal performance. In Part 3, the algorithm's resilience to sensor dropout was evaluated, testing how effectively it operates when specific measurements are unavailable.
